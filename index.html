        <h3>Welcome to Get Localization for Mac (BETA)</h3>
<p>Get Localization for Mac is by far the simplest way to localize your iOS and Mac OS X apps that have been developed using Xcode. It manages all the files and it generates the strings files from your Objective-C, XIB and storyboard files and updates them. It also syncs them between <a href="http://www.getlocalization.com">Get Localization</a> and your Xcode project. Just select your .xcodeproj file, log-in and select the project where you wish to sync your strings files and you are ready to go.
</p>
<p>Currently supports: Xcode 5.0.x</p>
<p>You can download the Mac installer here.</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/glformac/GLforMac-0.98.650.pkg">Download Get Localization for Mac v0.98.612b (.pkg)</a></p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>Note to v0.90.xx users: Get Localization for Mac now only supports the Base localization feature. 
  This is simply because it's default for new projects in Xcode and it also supports storyboard localization etc. 
  You can switch the base localization on from your project settings.
</p>
<h4>Configure your Xcode project</h4>

<p>Get Localization Mac requires that you are using Base localization feature. You can enable that from Xcode
project settings. Also for XIB and storyboard files you need to add English language and define Localizable.strings
as a type.
</p>

<p>For each XIB and storyboard, you need to define following attributes in Xcode:</p>

<strong>Note that English (and rest of the languages that are added automatically) use Localizable.strings file for all the XIBs and storyboards. This is because Get Localization
  for Mac will generate and update the required files instead of Xcode.</strong>
</p>
<br />


<h3>Good to know</h3>

<p>Get Localization for Mac will take care of strings, xib and storyboard files. For
  example if you update storyboard file, Get Localization for Mac will generate the appropriate
  strings file. Also when translated strings file for XIB is ready, the actual XIB is generated automatically.
  You can forget ibtool, genstrings etc. tools.

<h3>Known limitations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Old style lproj names e.g. English.lproj are not supported.</li>
  <li>Currently only English is supported as a master language i.e. en.lproj is required</li>
  <li>We have tested with many Xcode projects but it's likely that we are not yet compatible with every file 
  and folder structure built inside Xcode. We would love to receive your .xcodeproj folder content (.pbxproj file) 
  in case you have any troubles.</li>
  <li>Currently doesn't provide much options for customization or configuration. Our goal is to keep required
  configuration at minimum but let us know if you would like to configure or customize something.
  </li>
  <li>Note that GL for Mac (BETA) alters your Xcode project and project files. It's highly recommended to use version control (git, mercurial)
    and do backups.
  </li>
</ul>
